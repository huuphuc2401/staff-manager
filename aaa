1. Become large and hard to maintenace
2. Take much time for training new dev
3. Hard to apply automation testing

Solution: 
- Separate X-MON to several parts, each part have an independent reponsibility. 
They run in different server (Use docker) and communication by Restful API with JSON data.

Advantage
1. Each part have a small scope, easier to maintenance.
2. We can choose technology appropriate for each part.
3. Dev take less time for training. Even if they don't know XMON, they can work for a part (Ex: CRUD api for Twilio)
4. We can apply test more easily for API
5. Flexible for team working. Ex: At the same time, Dev A write API, Dev B write Frontent, Tester C write automation test for API.
6. Using docker help us to set up environment very fast

Disadvantage
1. Join data is very hard
